File by: Adam Plumer
Date created: Jan 30, 2016

1. All elements of the assignment have been correctly implemented and
   tested using the W3 validators. The stylesheet has at least five rules
   in it, and was also properly validated

2. I have not collaborated with anyone, but I have used online resources
   like StackExchange to assist with debugging validation errors

3. I have spent a total of four hours on this assignment
